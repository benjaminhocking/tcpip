# tcpip
artificial tcpip simulation
# Aims
-[] Create an abstrated system with individually acting computer components
-[ ] Allow the simulation's operation to be observed at any intermediatory stage, allowing the simulation to act as a model from which to learn
-[ ] Create hosts on the simulation
-[ ] Create routers/switches for routing traffic
-[ ] Allow user to intercept traffic (packets)
